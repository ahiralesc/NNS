This repository aggregated many NLP (Natural Language Processing) constructs for:
- Text normalization.
- Text fingerprint generation.
- And similarity search.

Similarity search is based on works from:
- Datar, M., Immorlica, N., Indyk, P. and Mirrokni, V.S. 2004. Locality-sensitive hashing scheme based on p-stable distributions. Proceedings of the twentieth annual symposium on Computational geometry (Jun. 2004)
- Gionis, A., Indyk, P. and Motwani, R. 1999. Similarity Search in High Dimensions via Hashing. Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases (San Francisco, CA, USA, 1999), 518â€“529.
